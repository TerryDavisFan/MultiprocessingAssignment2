# MultiprocessingAssignment2

1) In my program, guests are picked randomly by the minotaur to enter the maze. Upon completion, they queue up to eat a cupcake, represented in code using a semaphore, if that is there first cupcake, they let the minotaur know and the minotaur adds a tally to a sign, represented using a global static integer. The minotaur checks this sign after letting in each guest to see how many guest have had a cupcake. When the sign shows that each guests has had at least one cupcake, the minotaur stops letting guests into the maze and the party is over. To use my program, the user should know that it starts by prompting the user to enter the number of guests and then how long a guest will take to eat a cupcake. This allows the user to see the program running in the case of having a smaller number of guest while also allowing them to speed up the program if there is a larger number of guests.
